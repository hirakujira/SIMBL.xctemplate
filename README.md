# SIMBL.xctemplate

The Xcode template in [MacForge](https://github.com/w0lfschild/MacForge) is too complated. So I made mine.

### Install

Download the whole project and copy `SIMBL.xctemplate` to `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/Project Templates/MacForge/`, restart Xcode then you can see the new template named SIMBL.

### Using other SIMBL manager?

Edit `TemplateInfo.plist` and change the value of `INSTALL_PATH`. Don't forget to put the .xctemplate folder to corresponding path.
